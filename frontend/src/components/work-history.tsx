This migration was successfully deployed to Vercel, eliminating website maintenance costs by 100% while ensuring a seamless transition from the previously existing no-code tools. I documented and showcased the now-public repository, which serves as an additional channel to engage with the research project IDEAS in public recreation and highlight the important work being done at the Applied Research Centre. Through these efforts, I achieved a 60% increase in website performance metrics and improved accessibility scores by 10%.",
